### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**Ike888/Ike888** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

After working for more than fourteen years in the medical field as a Medical Spanish Interpreter, I was introduced and fascinated by the 50-year old protein-folding challenge; scientists worldwide had tried to solve this puzzle for half a century without much success. Artificial Intelligence finally solved this grand challenge of biology in 2020. As a result, I got interested in deep learning and machine learning. AI is a unique and powerful tool that can be applied to almost any field. I would love to utilize my previous professional experience with AI in my future position.
