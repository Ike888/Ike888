### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


<!-- **Ike888/Ike888** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->

I'm a Data Scientist with experience working in teams developing various projects using Python, Pandas Scikit-learn, Keras, TensorFlow, and SQL. I love problem-solving and thinking of creative ways to solve challenges. I have extensive experience working in the medical field as a Medical Spanish Interpreter; as a result, I'm bringing to the table experience working in large organizations teams, and I've also held supervising positions.
